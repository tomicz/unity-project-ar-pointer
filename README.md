# About

AR Pointer is a helper tool made for developers that can indicate where the ARCamera is pointing in Augmented Reality. Most AR experiences at some point 
will require an indicator that guides the user where to place content or how to navigate AR application. AR Pointer is a perfect solution for developers
who prefer to develop AR experiences rapidly.

### Requirements

  * <b>ARFoundation</b> - It's the the only and best solution for AR apps, runs on Android and iOS. 
  * <b>Unity 2019+</b>
  
### Features

  * Detect trackables (ARPlane)
  * Move selected object
  * Place selected object onto ARPlane
  * Grab placed object and return it to selection
  * Enable/Disable pointer (it's a good practice to disable pointer when is not used to save on performance, because AR applications are performance hungry).
